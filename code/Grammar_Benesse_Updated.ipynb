      "I have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , today , not all students can get education in a college . \n",
      "Because it needs a lot of money , but some students do n't have enough money . \n",
      "So it is difficult to get education for poor students . \n",
      "However , if it is free , they get a chance to learn in college . \n",
      "Second , students can use money to some thing instead of paying for college . \n",
      "They want to use money for clothes , their hobby and other things . \n",
      "It is helpful for their lives . \n",
      "For these reasons , i agree with it . \n",
      "I agree with this opinion . \n",
      "I have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , if it is not a university money , students can use their money for them . \n",
      "I think university students need a lot of money because they want to use it a lot of ways . \n",
      "For example , food , clothes , shoes , traffic , and their hobbies . \n",
      "Second , if it is not a university money , students can study well . \n",
      "University money is very expensive . \n",
      "If they pay , they have to work . \n",
      "But , if they work , they can not have a study time . \n",
      "University is a high level to study . \n",
      "I think they need time to study . \n",
      "There are reasons , i agree with the opinion . \n",
      "I agree with this opinion . \n",
      "Because it gives a chance to study something to all of people . \n",
      "There are many people who can not study if they want to . \n",
      "Because they are poor . \n",
      "If they have a lot of money , they can study in university . \n",
      "So the idea has a big chance . \n",
      "I think that Japan is less than other countries who graduated from university . \n",
      "If the idea comes true , the number of it is increasing . \n",
      "But , it is difficult to come true this idea . \n",
      "Because there is no money to come true this idea . \n",
      "So the government should make an effort to come true this great idea . \n",
      "Finally , this idea makes this world better than now . \n",
      "So i hope this world will come true . \n",
      "Thank you . \n",
      "I agree with this idea . \n",
      "I have a lot of reasons . \n",
      "First , if we do not need money to learn , we can study harder because of thanks . \n",
      "Second , many poor people can study as well as people who have more money . \n",
      "And , poor people can be the person they want to be . \n",
      "Third , we can use money to study to buy something that we need to . \n",
      "Then , we can have a wonderful life . \n",
      "For this reason , many universal cities have to stop to need money to study . \n",
      "I think it is difficult , but if the world comes , we will be happier . \n",
      "I agree with this opinion . \n",
      "I have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , i think there are many people who do not have much money . \n",
      "For example , they are poor high school students . \n",
      "They have played a lot of money to go to high school . \n",
      "So , they do not have much money . \n",
      "Second , college students can buy many things that they like . \n",
      "If i am in case of that , i will buy cool car , cool clothes and cool speakers . \n",
      "I think this opinion can be spread to their dreams and make them very happy . \n",
      "That is why , i agree with this opinion . \n",
      "I agree with this opinion . \n",
      "I have some reasons for this . \n",
      "First , money to the university is very expensive . \n",
      "Some people may not be able to go to the university because of money . \n",
      "If money to university was free , they can go there . \n",
      "Second , more people can study at the university . \n",
      "Not only students but also adults will go to the university to study what they want to study . \n",
      "The university will grow more people to our country 's future . \n",
      "I think that it is great . \n",
      "Third , the university will do n't have to think about money . \n",
      "If the money was free , the government would pay the money for university . \n",
      "So the university no longer have to relay the student 's money . \n",
      "It will solve the problem of money . \n",
      "For these reasons I agree with this opinion . \n",
      "I do n't think that the cost needed to study in university . \n",
      "I have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , when you want to study about high level things , you have to pay expensive money to study at a university . \n",
      "However , there are some poor people . \n",
      "They can n't study there even though they want to do it because they do n't have enough money . \n",
      "So they give up studying in university . \n",
      "It is bad for our country . \n",
      "We may lose good scientists , officers and so on caused by problem of domestic economics . \n",
      "Second , if a lot of people want to go to university , they will try to study harder than any other people to pass the entrance examination . \n",
      "University will be able to collect high level students . \n",
      "So , i do n't think that the cost needed to study in university . \n",
      "I think this opinion is good . \n",
      "I have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , if we do n't pay the money to university , we can use a lot of money to do . \n",
      "For example we can go to wherever we want to go and we can buy whatever we want to have . \n",
      "It is very good ! \n",
      "Second , if we do n't pay the money to university , we do n't need to think about money . \n",
      "The money to go to university is very expensive . \n",
      "Our teacher says < sunk > < sunk > The money to student goes to university is about men . \n",
      "Every day . \n",
      "If we do n't pay this money , our home is better . \n",
      "I think this opinion is very good because of these reasons . \n",
      "I hope that we do n't need to pay the money to go to the university . \n",
      "I agree with this opinion . \n",
      "I have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , there are many students who do n't have enough money to be a college student . \n",
      "I think it is unfair . \n",
      "If that students had greated ability , it would be wasted . \n",
      "Second , the money which we pay for the college is too much for the poor . \n",
      "It is difficult for them to pay a lot of money for the college . \n",
      "If they do that , they can n't buy anything that needed their lives . \n",
      "I think that it should be fair between the rich and the poor . \n",
      "So i agree with this opinion . \n",
      "I agree that universities should be free because i think there are many people who can not pay the cost of the university . \n",
      "And there are many sharp people who can not pay the cost of the university too . \n",
      "So i think the government should give a chance they can learn at the university for them . \n"

      "First , if people who have a great ability has a little money , they can n't study at a university . \n",

      "It will make a university better . \n",
      "For these reasons , i agree with this idea . \n",
      "I agree with that idea . \n",
      "I have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , if we can go to university with no money , a lot of people can go to university to study . \n",
      "I think that part of students in Japan will feel or say , '' i want to study , but i ca n't . \n",
      "Because i am poor and i do n't have enough money to study . \n",
      "I think they have light to study . \n",
      "For example , in foreign countries , the student who wants to study can go to university with no money . \n",
      "So the university in Japan also does it for japanese students . \n",
      "Second , if we do n't have to pay lots of money to university , we can use money in another direction . \n",
      "For instance , we can use money to go to the hospital , we can use more money to live for the future and so on . \n",
      "For these reasons , i agree with that idea . \n",
      "I think the government should give a chance to everyone to study in college without paying money . \n",
      "I have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , it will give poor people a chance to study more . \n",
      "These days , many students borrow a lot of money to study in college , and it 's hard for them to pay it for many years . \n",
      "Second , it may solve many problems . \n",
      "For example , in Japan , the number of children are increasing . \n",

      "If the young have enough money , they can get married and many children may be born . \n",
      "That 's why i thought that . \n",
      "I agree with this opinion . \n",
      "There are reasons . \n",
      "First , the money spent on some university by side of students are too much for some people who were even good students . \n",
      "This is a big problem when a student wants to go to a university . \n",
      "But if the money spent on some universities by side of students become no , some students and their families will do not have to consider their money when they want to go to some universities . \n",
      "Second , students who graduated there are most smart . \n",
      "A long time , and even now The world wants good people who work well and who are smart and can think of what he or she has to do himself or herself . \n",
      "University can grow many students smart . \n",

      "But if the money spent there by my parents ' money becomes no , i can easily want to go to a university and talk about that with my parents and my friends who want to go there . \n",
      "I hope that the opinions become real . \n",
      "I agree with this opinion that does not need money to go to the university . \n",
      "I have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , if i can not go to the university because i do not have money , i am very sad . \n",

      "I agree with this opinion that it does n't need to study at university . \n",
      "I have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , i think that if we do n't need money for study at university , many people who want to study there can study more . \n",
      "Second , if anybody does n't need a test to study at a university , we do n't need to study for the test . \n",

      "So people should study hard . \n",
      "But , there are people who do n't have enough money to enter the college . \n",
      "In my opinion , everyone has the right to learn something who wants to know . \n",
      "What i mean by that , i think it is unfair . \n",
      "Learning will make us smarter and rich . \n",
      "Maybe we will need knowledge at the office . \n",
      "In short , without knowledge , we can not be rich . \n",
      "So people should enter college and study something that we can not study before . \n",
      "In my case , i want to study law . \n",
      "Because i want to be a lawyer . \n",
      "So i want to enter college . \n",
      "So i agree with this opinion . \n",
      "I agree that universities should be free . \n",
      "If should not be free , someone could n't go to university . \n",
      "For example , men are as good as test scores , but rich men can go to university and poor man ca n't do . \n",
      "That is unfair . \n",
      "I think that everyone should go to a university . \n",
      "In addition , if should be free , people who are in university would add . \n",
      "If people who are in university should add , our life would be better than the present . \n",
      "Because our life depends on the university . \n",
      "Therefore , i agree that universities should be free . \n",
      "I agree with this opinion . \n",
      "Because i have reasons for this . \n",
      "First , if we do n't have to pay money for learning at university , we can use the money some other ways . \n",
      "For example , clothes , food , sports and so on . \n",
      "It may spread our possibilities about the future . \n",
      "Second , the opinion makes many people enter university , and people who have great brains are found out . \n",
      "They will change Japan to a perfect country in terms of science , biology and so on . \n",
      "Benefit of it is that anyone who is poor or rich have a chance to become a famous person . \n",
      "For these reasons : \n",
      "I think if the opinion becomes real , Japan is the best country in the world . \n",
      "So , i agree with this opinion . \n",
      "I think that we should n't pay no money to university . \n",
      "I have reasons for supporting my idea . \n",
      "First , i think we should spend money on each thing . \n",

      "I agree with no learning price at the university . \n",

      "So , i think we must not violate that right and must respect that rights . \n",
      "I agree with this idea and think it 's great . \n",
      "I have a reason for this . \n",
      "If this system is carried out , more people are now able to go to university . \n",
      "In the world , there are people who want to go there but they can n't because of the poor . \n",
      "So we should start this system right now . \n",
      "I do n't think so . \n",
      "I have reasons : \n",
      "First , it is not necessary for people who do n't go to the university to pay the university 's money . \n",

      "It is difficult for us to do that idea . \n",
