I think it will be important that "how will you express yourself". Robots can "think" and "progress" themselves, but they won't be expressing. Expressions can be anything. It could be your communication abilty, art, science, sports abilty or writing abilty. I think it's important because if you express, people will find you. They will think you are necessary person than robots or you will be a good affection for the company. So, now we become adults, we should learn how to express ourselves. You should experience as much as you can, and study a lot, and also read many books. Learning will show you different ways of life and different things that you will love. Now highschool days isa great stage for practicing expressions. We must use this chance and let's get a job that we want to do!!
